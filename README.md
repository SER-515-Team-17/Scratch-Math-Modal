# Scratch-Math-Modal 
This repository is specifically for course SER 515- Foundations of Software Engineering. In this repository, we will find all the developers(Geeky Coders) banging their heads and figuring out how can we make a Math Model for Scratch. 

If we need help at any point in time, always remember our one and only friend, Google. And also how can we forget Stack Overflow. 

While building any software or a prototype, we must adhere to some set of guidelines because that's what will make us great Software Engineers.  

Feel free to add more and more rules around the pattern of coding and we will make sure that we follow them.

# Setting up the project [ Step by Step Guidelines ]

1. Clone the project from the command line by command: ```git clone https://github.com/SER-515-Team-17/Scratch-Math-Modal.git```

2. Check Java version your system is: Make sure it's updated one and Java 8 would be preferred.

3. If Java is not installed, make sure you install java first. Link from where you can install is https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html .Here you can find you Java SE Development Kit 8u221 for your preferred system. Install the required version and after it is installed you can check the version in the command line. 

   Checking the version for macOS use command ```java --version ```. Please see what will be the command for your OS.

4. After your project has successfully cloned, checkout to master branch by command ```git checkout master```

5. One of the requirement while working with Electron application will be node and npm should be installed in your system. For development purposes, you will need npm and node for doing a lot of tasks. 

If you install node, npm will be automatically installed with the package. You can install node in any way you want but I would recommend doing it from the command line. 

Installing node in macOS: If you have homebrew installed on your system, open the Terminal app and type ```brew update```. This updates Homebrew with a list of the latest version of Node. Then install node by command ```brew install node```.
   
If you do not have homebrew installed, Install it through below provided a link and then you can go to the above step.    https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/homebrew 
   
   
6. After the node has installed fully, make sure you check the version of node and npm through the terminal to make sure everything is up to the mark. Commands for checking node and npm version is ```node --version``` and ```npm --version```. 
  
  
7. Now try to run the application by command ```electron```. This will open a new window which will give you confirmation of whether the electron is working or not.


8. Now for demo purpose try to run ```electron ./main.js``` and you will see a demo application. This is just for testing purpose of whether electron application will work or not.
