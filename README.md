# Scratch-Math-Modal 
This repository is specifically for course SER 515- Foundations of Software Engineering. In this repository,we will find all the developers(Geeky Coders) banging their heads and figuring out how can we make a Math Model for Scratch. 

If we need help at any point of time, always remember our one and only friend, Google. And also how can we forget Stack Overflow. 

While building any software or a prototype , we must adhere to some set of guidelines because thats what will make us great Software Engineers.  

Feel free to add more and more rules around the pattern of coding and we will make sure that we follow them.

# Setting up the project [ Step by Step Guidelines ]

1. Clone the project from command line by command: ```git clone https://github.com/SER-515-Team-17/Scratch-Math-Modal.git```

2. Check Java version your system is :  Make sure its updated one and Java 8 would be preferred.

3. If Java is not installed ,make sure you install java first. Link from where you can install is https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html .Here you can find you Java SE Development Kit 8u221 for your preferred system. Install the required version and after it is installed you can check the version in command line. 

Checking the version for macOs use command ```java --version``` . Please see what will be the command for your OS.
