# Scratch-Math-Modal 
This repository is specifically for course SER 515- Foundations of Software Engineering. In this repository,we will find all the developers(Geeky Coders) banging their heads and figuring out how can we make a Math Model for Scratch. 

If we need help at any point of time, always remember our one and only friend, Google. And also how can we forget Stack Overflow. 

While building any software or a prototype , we must adhere to some set of guidelines because thats what will make us great Software Engineers.  

Feel free to add more and more rules around the pattern of coding and we will make sure that we follow them.
